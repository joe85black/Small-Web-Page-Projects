        <p>I know why you are here. I started seeing it years ago when my wife started her first company. Endless stress, a million things to do and not enough time to do them.</p>
        <p>Originally she had hired a company to the IT for her, at this point I already was working 60 hours a week for another company.</p>
        <p>It came to a breaking point. Basic functions were not working, her different software subscriptions were unable to communicate and she was having to do most things manually.</p>
        <p>We realized that there was a real need for good IT work for entrepeneurs</p>
